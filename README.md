# Voice_Assistant
We have built/programmed a software or rather a Virtual assistant which hears/listens the users command and provides the necessary information or function. Itâ€™s a user-friendly interface for carrying out a variety of tasks. With the microphone of the device as the input device, the program listens to the query/command of the user. Converts the audio input into text using the functions in speech recognition library. Searches if the command(text) given are present in the written code. If yes it replies back to the user with an adequate response. The voice assistant stays active until we give it a command for it to stop. The voice assistant can do anything from opening apps on the pc to searching information on the net.
